    <h2> God </h2>
    <p>What specifically was the pursuit of God in the precolonial time period? The short answer is explorers coming to America wanting to spread Christianity. The Native Americans already living in America had their own religions and gods, such as the Cherokee tribe believing that the world was an island that was terraformed by powerful sentient animals. The religions of the natives were thought to be primitive so missionaries sailed to the Americas to convert the Native Americans to Christianity. This shows in today's society, not only in the over 60% of Americans who are Christian but also in the lack of Native American religions. The latter is not only due to precolonial Americans converting them to Christianity, but it did play a part. In my opinion, God has had the strongest role in shaping modern American society.

    <h2>Gold</h2>
    <p>The pursuit of gold in precolonial America is pretty straightforward. Initially, the explorers were looking for an easier trade route to Asia to buy spices they could earn a large profit on in Europe. Explorers and early settlers searched for actual gold and silver as well. The reason that Christopher Columbus sailed to the Americas in the first place was because he thought he could sail across the Atlantic Ocean, straight to India.
